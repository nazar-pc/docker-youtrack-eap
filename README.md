# docker-youtrack
*Easy youtrack deployment using docker*

These Dockerfiles allow you to easily build images to deploy your own [youtrack](http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) instance.
It's free for up to ten users.

# EAP
This is version forked from dzwicker/docker-youtrack and differs only by using latest EAP version of YouTrack instead of stable version.

## Disclaimer
Besides that, as always, use these scripts with care.

Don't forget to back up your data very often, too.

## Requirements
Docker has to run. It supports many platforms like Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, EC2 or the Google Cloud.
[Click here](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/) to get specific infos on how to install on your platform.

You also need some RAM for youtrack, but I can't really tell how much. Maybe about 200-300MB.

## Oh nice! How do I do it?
1. Install docker. [It's not very hard.](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/)
2. Run it! (Stop with CTRL-C, repeat at pleasure)

  `docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 dzwicker/docker-youtrack`



Now open your browser and point it to `http://localhost:8080` and rejoice. :)

## Do it as service in ubuntu/debian
1. Create directory to store data
  
  `mkdir -p /var/lib/youtrack`

2. Create container!

  `docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v /var/lib/youtrack:/var/lib/youtrack --name docker-youtrack dzwicker/docker-youtrack`

3. Stop it!
4. Create upstart configuration `/etc/init/docker-youtrack.conf`

	``` bash
	description "Docker Youtrack"
	start on filesystem and started docker
	stop on runlevel [!2345]
	respawn
	script
	  /usr/bin/docker start -a docker-youtrack >>/var/log/docker-youtrack.log 2>&1
	end script

	```
5. (optional) Setup logrotate e.g. `/etc/logrotate.d/docker-youtrack`


	```
	/var/log/docker-youtrack.log {
	    rotate 7
	    daily
	    missingok
	    notifempty
	    sharedscripts
	    copytruncate
	    compress
	}
	```
6. (optional) Add vhost to nginx

	`mkdir -p /var/log/nginx/your-domain`

	```
	upstream docker-youtrack {
	  server localhost:8080;
	}

	server {
	  listen 80;
	  server_name           your-domain.com;

	  access_log            /var/log/nginx/your-domain/access.log;
	  error_log             /var/log/nginx/your-domain/error.log;

	  proxy_set_header Host       $http_host;   # required for docker client's sake
	  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr; # pass on real client's IP

	  client_max_body_size 0; # disable any limits to avoid HTTP 413 for large image uploads

	  # required to avoid HTTP 411: see Issue #1486 (https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/1486)
	  chunked_transfer_encoding on;

	  location / {
	    proxy_pass http://docker-youtrack;
	  }

	}
	```
